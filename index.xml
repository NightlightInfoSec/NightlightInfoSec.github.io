      <description>But I Do The Very Thing I Hate  For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. � Romans 7:15 (ESV)
 At the end of each year, like I�m sure most do, I reflect on the things that I have accomplished. It�s great to remember all of the good things, but more often than not I find myself thinking about all of the things I didn�t do.</description>

      <description>I Just Bought A Domain: Now What A Cautionary Tale Writing a blog post is such a great way to solidify your thoughts.
When you write, you really have to think about what you are saying.
When you buy a domain name though, sometimes you are living in the moment and forget about being logical.
Planning After I bought my domain name, I wanted to jump right in and start learning the ins and outs of creating a website.</description>

      <description>ABOUT ME I&#39;m a SOC analyst trying to learn new things.
I had been thinking about creating a website for myself, but could never seem to come up with a good name.
Then one night after putting my kids to bed, I looked over at their nightlight and thought about all the times I have stayed up studying after putting them to bed.
I immediately checked to see if the name was registered, and that&#39;s how NightlightInfoSec.</description>

      <description>ABOUT ME I&amp;rsquo;m a SOC analyst trying to learn new things.
I had been thinking about creating a website for myself, but could never seem to come up with a good name.
Then one night after putting my kids to bed, I looked over at their nightlight and thought about all the times I have stayed up studying after putting them to bed.
I immediately checked to see if the name was registered, and that&amp;rsquo;s how NightlightInfoSec.</description>
